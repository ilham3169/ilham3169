## About me

Hi there 👋. I’m Ilham Yagubzade, Hard-working university student with a strong passion for technology and innovations. I have 3 years of experience in Python, 6 months of experience in HTML/CSS and one-on-one instruction, and finally 1 year of experience on ROS2 - Robot Operating System.  I am eager to bring this knowledge to my academic career and break into the technology industry.
